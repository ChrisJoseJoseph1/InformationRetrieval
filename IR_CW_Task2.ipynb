The White House is said to be considering the deployment of military advisers and new weaponry to Ukraine in a move that would probably cross President Putin’s “red lines”.Air defence systems, such as stinger missiles, as well as Mi-17 helicopters, Javelin anti-tank missiles and mortars are among the military equipment being discussed, CNN reported, citing sources close to the Biden administration.Benny Gantz said an Iranian drone that was shot down over Israel in 2018 was believed to have been the first recorded effort to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to smuggle weaponry.', 'Three times as many asylum seekers and migrants have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year compared with last year, after nearly 900 made the crossing on Saturday. British officials rescued or intercepted 886 people in 28 incidents, the Home Office confirmed today.', 'French fishermen are planning to “disturb British interests” by blockading Calais in their campaign to win more licences to work in UK waters. The blockades, which will be designed to affect goods heading across the Channel from France to Britain, are likely to start at the end of the week. Details of the operation will be revealed on Thursday, but the trawlermen have made clear their intention to target British supply lines in the hope of emptying supermarket shelves.', 'Before his latest record Freedom came the album Justice.

The White House announced it would endorse a second term for the central bank’s top official today after months of deliberations.', 'At least 18 ships are stuck in Arctic sea ice off the coast of Russia after an unexpected early freeze took shipping companies by surprise. Some could be stranded for months as they wait for icebreakers to reach them. In recent years warmer weather triggered by climate change has allowed ships to cross parts of Russia’s northern sea route in November without the help of icebreakers. Ship owners had assumed this month would be no different.', 'President Macron denounced his detractors as demagogues as he teed up his re-election campaign with a claim that he needed more time to complete the transformation of France. On a visit to his home town of Amiens in the north of the country, Macron, 43, sought to portray himself as a head of state capable of driving France forward, while his opponents were sowing division and doubt.', 'A former Russian admiral has claimed that a Nato vessel was probably to blame for the sinking of the Kursk nuclear submarine. The pride of Russia’s Northern Fleet sank in the icy Barents Sea in 2000, killing all 118 people on board. The official cause was an explosion in its torpedo section during a training exercise. At a cost of $1 billion the 14,000-tonne submarine was designed to be unsinkable.', 'Thousands of demonstrators poured onto the streets of European capitals at the weekend as governments stepped up restrictions to combat the latest Covid wave sweeping the continent.

Traditionally, they were seen as companies owned, and often also run, by the founders’ descendants. Think Warburtons, the baker, or the Bamford family at JCB. But the Institute for Family Business (IFB), which has organised this week’s focus on family companies, argues that any business that is majority-owned by members of the same family qualifies.', 'For Rob Pierre, co-founder and chief executive of the digital advertising business Jellyfish, international expansion was initially something of a happy accident. Having started the company in Reigate in 2005, Pierre and his co-founder, Paul Walsh, opened in South Africa in 2008 after a key employee asked to return to her home city of Durban.', 'Young people will not join companies that are inflexible about how their staff choose to work, a study suggests. More than half of those aged 18 to 34 said that they did not believe they had to be in an office full-time. More than a third said that they had made a career change to work more flexibly during the pandemic.', 'Businesses that respond to the government’s call to export more may have to restructure their business and cut jobs, one small company owner has warned. Hampstead Tea normally sends 40 tonnes of the tea it sources from biodynamic tea gardens in Darjeeling, India, and blends and packs in its factory in Milton Keynes, to customers in the European Union. This trade collapsed, however, to less than four tonnes in the first six months of this year as paperwork and customs problems meant shipments failed to reach their destination.', 'New applications for unemployment benefits in the United States dropped to their lowest level since 1969 in the past week.

The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 96.5 from 97.7 in October.', 'Scotland’s economy is still below its pre-pandemic peak in spite of growth in September.

The flash, or preliminary, reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS composite purchasing managers’ index for November suggested that costs for businesses in the private sector had risen at their fastest pace since January 1998 and at a similar pace to last month.', 'The proportion of women in the workforce has risen during the pandemic after companies allowed employees to split their time between home and the office, research has found. Flexible working has tempted many women back into the labour market and persuaded those in employment to increase their hours, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank said that about half a million women with part-time jobs have switched to full-time since the pandemic struck.', 'Rising inflation and supply chain disruption mean that the economy will grow at a slower pace than expected this year and next, according to the EY Item Club’s latest forecast. The economy will grow by 6.9 per cent this year and by 5.6 per cent next year, it said in its autumn forecast. This is down from its July prediction of growth of 7.6 per cent and 6.5 per cent, respectively, although it would still mean that growth this year was the strongest since 1941.', 'The chief executive of Johnson Matthey’s biggest division has resigned after missing out on the top job. The news comes just days after the metallurgy company shocked shareholders by abandoning ambitious plans to make electric car batteries. Joan Braca, head of the catalytic converters division, which accounts for more than half of group profits, is leaving next month, the company said, as for the first time it put a price on the batteries U-turn, a write-off of the project’s entire £314 million value in the books.', 'Intercontinental Hotels was among today’s steepest risers, fuelled by hopes for a sharp rebound in the US travel industry.

The regulator’s annual review of company reporting against the UK corporate governance code said that some statements “are seldom substantiated by actions or examples” and were therefore useless to investors.', 'Difficulties with the introduction of a new IT system and a warning about a higher-than-expected wages bill took the shine off strong results from Brewin Dolphin, the wealth manager. The company reported £2.1 billion of net new inflows from customers in the year to September, helping to push up pre-tax profits by 16.7 per cent to £72.5 million and lifting total assets under management to £56.9 billion.', 'That’s the thing with handbrake turns. It’s not always clear if you’re back on a better road. A £314 million write-off for pulling the plug on its electric car battery technology looks the least of Johnson Matthey’s problems. The bigger issue is the strategic fog it’s driven into and whether the chemicals group hasn’t turned itself into a takeover target.', 'An American green investment firm co-founded by Warren Buffett’s grandson is seeking to raise some £20 million from a listing on Aim, London’s junior stock market. The company, i(x) Net Zero, is expected to announce in the next few days plans for a flotation that could put a valuation of at least £70 million on the business.', 'JP Morgan is racing to shore up its relationship with Beijing after it emerged the boss of America’s biggest bank had joked that the Wall Street giant would outlast China’s Communist party.

Kensington Mortgages and the insurer Rothesay are jointly offering the package, allowing borrowers who can put down a 40 per cent deposit to fix their mortgage at an interest rate of 3.34 per cent for 40 years.', 'Rank Group has hit the jackpot after securing a VAT refund of more than £80 million on slot machine takings. The Grosvenor Casinos and Mecca Bingo operator said that it had reached agreement with HM Revenue & Customs on a rebate of £77.5 million, which it expects to receive shortly. Rank said that interest was also due on the claim, expected to amount to £5.5 million. However, both amounts will be subject to corporation tax.', 'The boss of Virgin Money UK, who is driving through an overhaul of Britain’s sixth-largest bank that has involved branch closures and job cuts, has seen his pay package more than double to £2.7 million. The amount handed to David Duffy in the year to the end of September is his second highest since Virgin floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2016. He received £1.35 million last year. It has been boosted by the vesting of a share-based incentive scheme from 2018, according to the bank’s annual report, released yesterday.', 'HSBC will buy back $2 billion of shares amid optimism about the economy as the bank’s profits rose by almost three quarters between July and September. The results were boosted by a $700 million release of cash HSBC no longer believed it would need to cover losses from Covid loans, compared with an $800 million provision a year ago.', 'A fall in the price of bitcoin sent the cryptocurrency market into turmoil yesterday as the digital asset became legal tender in El Salvador. Bitcoin rose above $52,000, only to drop in the afternoon to just under $43,000 before a partial rebound to $46,782.93 last night in New York. Several crypto trading platforms suffered outages, blamed on investors reacting to the sudden slump in bitcoin.', 'Ralf Rangnick has emerged as the leading candidate to become the interim manager at Manchester United. While sources at Old Trafford have told The Times that no agreement has yet been signed, there is growing confidence that the 63-year-old German will soon be in charge.', 'Fifa is set to announce that it will test technology to automatically detect when players are offside at next week’s Arab Cup in Qatar in what is being seen as a dry run for the 2022 World Cup. An artificial intelligence system will be in place at six stadiums in the 16-team tournament. It works by sending the video assistant referee (VAR) an instant message when a player is offside and the official will then make a decision on whether they were interfering with play or not.', 'Among the most influential players in this season’s Champions League have been some of the usual suspects: Mohamed Salah, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Lewandowski. But two other players have also stood out, perhaps more unexpectedly. Sébastien Haller’s two goals in Ajax’s 2-1 win over Besiktas took his tally for the tournament to nine — not only putting him equal with Lewandowski at the top of this seaosn’s scoring charts, but also establishing a new record for the most goals that any player has scored in their first five appearances in this competition. Erik ten Hag’s team were struggling at half-time in Istanbul, trailing 1-0, but the introduction of Haller inspired them to their fifth straight win in the group.', 'Mikel Arteta is hopeful of bringing the former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger back to the Emirates Stadium in some capacity after revealing initial talks have taken place. The 72-year-old Frenchman was in charge of the north London club for almost 22 years, winning three Premier League titles and two doubles before calling it a day in May 2018.', 'Every member of the Crouch review panel will have their own view of the most impactful moment during our collection of evidence. But for me there were two. The first was talking to Gary Neville and his mother, Jill, the former club secretary of Bury FC. The story of how Bury foundered was a scandal, but just as much, it was a tragedy. It was moving to see what it meant to the family. And I do not get the impression that the Nevilles are overly sentimental.', 'If Pep Guardiola and Mauricio Pochettino, reportedly a top target for the Manchester United vacancy, are to eventually renew their rivalry on a local stage then they will do so with the Manchester City manager having emphatically won this encounter with his Paris Saint-Germain counterpart. With victory at the Etihad Stadium last night came the guarantee of top spot in group A and a ninth consecutive season of the Champions League knockout stages for City, no small level of consistency.', 'The timing is so right for the fan-led governance review published by Tracey Crouch MP. English football urgently needs Crouch’s calls for greater tests on owners’ integrity and funds, for a transfer levy to transform the pyramid’s finances and also for the appointment of an independent regulator, a sheriff with legislative weaponry to bring some order to the Wild West of English football. The timing is right because the Covid-19 pandemic has sent footballing finances further into a tailspin, communities need their clubs even more and clubs are threatened by unscrupulous or hapless owners.', 'Michael Vaughan has been removed from the BBC’s Test Match Special radio coverage of the Ashes after allegations that he used racially offensive language during a county match in 2009. BT Sport may also change its television coverage plans for this winter’s series to avoid including him.', 'In terms of preparations for an Ashes tour down under, the series in 2010-11 is often held up as the gold standard. England played three first-class matches on that trip — beating Western Australia and drawing with South Australia, when rain probably prevented another victory, before thrashing Australia A by ten wickets in Hobart with a second-string attack (the main bowlers had been sent to Brisbane in readiness for the first Test).', 'Super League matches will be broadcast live on free-to-air television for the first time in the competition’s history in 2022 after a two-year deal was agreed with Channel 4. Ten games are to be shown next season, starting with Warrington Wolves’ trip to Leeds Rhinos on Saturday, February 12, kicking off at 12.30pm.', 'Steve Smith is a step closer to becoming the Australia vice-captain after being interviewed by a specially formed Cricket Australia selection committee. With the present vice-captain, Pat Cummins, expected to be promoted after the surprise resignation of Tim Paine over the emergence of sexually explicit text messages, Smith is in line for a controversial return to a leadership position, having been sacked as captain for his role in the ball-tampering scandal in 2018.', 'Doubts are growing over the future of Johanna Konta because of uncertainty surrounding the former British No 1’s participation in January’s Australian Open. At present ranked a lowly No 112 in the world, the 30-year-old could miss out on direct entry to the first grand-slam tournament of 2022 when the initial cut is made on December 6. A total of 104 spots are available for players in the main-draw entry list. The event starts in Melbourne on January 17.', 'Bath are to appoint a defence coach as they seek to turn around a miserable start to the season that has left them bottom of the Gallagher Premiership table after losing their first seven games. As the only team in the Premiership without a specialist defence coach, Bath have conceded 30 tries in those seven defeats and only Worcester Warriors, one place above them, have conceded more. They have also scored only 14 tries, the fewest in the league.', 'After that international nonsense, the best league in the world is back and begins with four Friday Night Light showdowns. Four . . . that’s insane. What is also insane is that we are on the cusp of December and Bath are still yet to win this season. At 0-7, this is Bath’s worst-ever start to a season. This sexy club needs a makeover from the ground up, although one aspect of that rebuild — the influx of youth — was present in the defeat at Welford Road three weeks ago.', 'Samoa and Tonga are likely to be the main beneficiaries of a groundbreaking rule that will allow players to switch allegiance if they have not played Test rugby for three years. A number of the smaller nations could be strengthened considerably as the likes of Israel Folau and Charles Piutau would be available for Tonga, while Julian Savea and Lima Sopoaga could play for Samoa.', 'The arrival of Ewan Ashman at Glasgow Warriors on a loan deal until the end of the 2021-22 season is a win, win and win situation for player, club and country, as far as Danny Wilson is concerned. The 21-year-old, who scored a spectacular try on his Scotland debut against Australia earlier this month, has made the switch to Scotstoun in search of the game time he needs in order to fully realise his undoubted potential, having failed to command a regular place in the match-day squad at Sale Sharks since making his debut for the Premiership outfit last September.', 'Manu Tuilagi faces an anxious wait to discover whether the hamstring injury he suffered scoring England’s first try against South Africa requires surgery that would rule him out of the Six Nations. Alex Sanderson, Tuilagi’s director of rugby at Sale Sharks, revealed that surgery would mean up to 12 weeks of rehabilitation for the 30-year-old. However, Sanderson is hoping that the centre’s specialist will rule out an operation, which would reduce the recovery time to six to eight weeks.', 'Exeter Chiefs will consult members on Wednesday before deciding whether to ditch the Native American imagery that is part of their branding. The Devon side officially adopted the name in 1999 having been known as the Chiefs since the 1930s. In July last year the club board decided not to change the name but the mascot Big Chief was retired, replaced by a hawk called Tom. Wasps reignited the debate last month when they asked Exeter’s fans not to wear headdresses to their Gallagher Premiership match at the Coventry Building Society Arena.', 'The FIA has made a robust response to veiled criticisms from Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen about its disciplinary process. Formula One’s governing body has been the subject of considerable criticism after the past two races and in particular for its decision not to punish Verstappen who appeared to force Hamilton off track in Brazil.', 'Lewis Hamilton’s world championship hopes have been boosted after his team promised him some “spicy equipment” for the next race in Saudi Arabia. The seven-times world champion is only eight points behind Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in the title race with two races to go after victory for Hamilton on Sunday in Qatar.', 'Christian Horner was officially warned last night for effectively bringing Formula One into disrepute as Lewis Hamilton closed the gap in the drivers’ championship with victory in Qatar. Tensions have been boiling over between Horner’s Red Bull team and Mercedes as the season reaches its climax. Two races ago Hamilton was trailing Red Bull’s Max Verstappen by 19 points, but after two victories the gap is only eight points with two grands prix remaining.', 'With a year to go until the football World Cup kicks off in Qatar, the fireworks were set off at the Losail International Circuit, which is a short drive from the stadium that will host the final. While the stadiums are mostly finished, the grounds around them are far from being completed and the rumble underfoot suggests that they will be working flat out until the first match begins.', 'Tiger Woods yesterday posted a video of himself hitting golf balls for the first time since suffering life-threatening injuries in a car crash in February. The 45-year-old uploaded a three-second video on social media of him striking irons at a driving range with the simple message: “Making progress,” implying that he is on the comeback trail.', 'It seemed we were headed down an all too familiar road when Rory McIlroy teed off for round three of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. Having finished round two with a painful double bogey after 35 effortless previous holes, the Northern Irishman snap-hooked his drive into the trees, forcing him to hack out, chip on and salvage a bogey. Few know the Earth Course at Jumeirah better than him — he has won this tournament twice — but it seemed that all of McIlroy’s good work this week might unravel. He responded well though, with seven birdies in the next 17 holes for a round of 67. On 14 under par he takes a one-shot lead into the fourth day of the season’s', 'This son of Dubawi showed much-improved form when winning on his all-weather debut at Chelmsford and looks to have been let in lightly on his handicap debut here. He stormed home by seven lengths there from Nizaaka, who was herself a wide-margin winner at this track on Monday. That gives the form a solid look, while his breeding suggests that he should be even more effective over this longer trip.', 'Racecourses in Britain have responded to concerns about the treatment of female jockeys by upgrading changing facilities and weighing rooms to new minimum standards. The news was announced on Monday as the sport braces itself for further damaging publicity at a hearing next Tuesday that will determine whether the jockey Robbie Dunne is guilty of bullying the leading female rider Bryony Frost.', 'Robbie Dunne will face a disciplinary panel next Tuesday having been charged with the bullying and harassment of his fellow jockey, Bryony Frost. Frost, 26, is the most successful female National Hunt rider in Britain and became the first woman to win the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park last December on board Frodon.', 'On a recent Sunday evening at London’s Dominion Theatre, I joined thousands of impeccably dressed, distressingly attractive twentysomethings milling in the glow of a huge “Welcome Home” sign projected onto the stage. This wholesome and diverse crowd looked as though they could be a casting call for a Christmas commercial, but clutching their Miracle Meal pre-filled communion cups and wafer sets, they were there for something more meaningful. If you want to spot a Premier League footballer in London, a service run by a Hillsong megachurch, of which there are now 12 in Britain, should be your first port of call.', 'I stepped into the ring as a way of losing weight. I was bullied when I was younger because of my weight and my African name. Sparring with Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte. I mixed it up with both of them and they both said how good my work was. Then, when Rob McCracken, the head coach at the 2012 Olympics, gave me compliments, I thought I might actually be good.', '\"Boxing is a crap magnet.” These are Frank Warren’s words, but he still loves the old game even after losing £17,500 on his first bout, being punched by Mike Tyson and shot by a man in Barking. After Tyson Fury’s hellish brawl with Deontay Wilder, you could say it is not just the WBC heavyweight champion who is adept at climbing off the canvas. Warren is back on top as Fury’s UK promoter. Eddie Hearn, his younger, smoother rival, has witnessed his own golden goose, Anthony Joshua, lose his lustre after two defeats in four fights. Warren, 69, waves off the notion that the scenario is satisfying and says there is still “regret” that the much-hyped, all-British unification fight never happened. ', '\"The man’s a sore loser and a proper shithouse,” were the words that Tyson Fury chose to describe Deontay Wilder after he had defeated him in their tumultuous heavyweight title fight in the early hours of Sunday. And “coward” and “idiot” besides. Wilder had now suffered successive defeats by Fury, after their first meeting in the trilogy was drawn. Yet, in this third bout, he was knocked down twice and had managed to stay in the fight until the 11th round at which point he was knocked down again — which doesn’t make him sound much like a coward at all.', 'The third successive year of growth for its main Lotto draw and public support for the lottery-funded Team GB at the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games have driven record first-half National Lottery ticket sales, Camelot said yesterday. Although demand for tickets and scratchcards through shops remained below their pre-pandemic levels, sales reached £3.96 billion for the six months to September 25, up 2.7 per cent on the same period last year.', 'Those concerned about the safety of the missing Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai were offered some reassurance yesterday when she appeared in several videos, the last of which involved a 30-minute video call with Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee. The videos came amid growing international concern for the welfare of Peng, 35, after she disappeared from public view this month having accused China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, 75, of forcing her to have sex, with his wife guarding the door, before she agreed to become his mistress.', 'Britain is in discussion with its Five Eyes security allies about a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing next year in protest at China’s record on human rights, including its persecution of dissident sports players. President Biden is poised to announce that neither he nor any US government officials will attend the Games.', 'Olympic and Paralympic athletes are to get increased funding from Sport Ireland from January, after winning 11 sets of medals in Tokyo last summer, sports minister Jack Chambers has confirmed. Some 22 “podium” athletes will stay on €40,000 annual tax-free supports, but grants will rise from €20,000 to €25,000 for “world class” athletes and from €12,000 to €18,000 for other international competitors.', 'Boris Johnson is considering a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing next year in protest at China’s record on human rights. President Biden is poised to announce a boycott, meaning that neither he nor any US government officials will attend the Games.', 'A leading actor has called for university quotas for white working-class pupils and for more grammar schools to open. Eddie Marsan, 53, who has appeared in War Horse, Ridley Road and Little Dorrit, said white children from working-class backgrounds should be recognised as a distinct group with problems that needed to be addressed.', 'Celebrities including Will.i.am have joined forces with industry leaders to back a campaign for engineering to be taught in primary schools. The songwriter, music producer and judge on The Voice has become an unlikely co-champion of training young children to be engineers. A group of 150 engineers, scientists and other supporters, led by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), has written to Boris Johnson saying this could transform the economy.', 'TikTok videos created by children at a Scottish school which are peppered with “derogatory comments” about staff and other pupils have been reported to police. Teachers at Our Lady and St Patrick’s High School in Dumbarton have become the latest to fall victim to pupil taunts online amid a surge in cases across the UK.', 'Teacher abuse on TikTok is abhorrent and deeply worrying, the education secretary has said in his first intervention on the issue. Head teachers have written to parents asking for their help in stopping the attacks, in which some teachers have been accused of paedophilia or subjected to homophobic remarks.', 'Russell Group universities are the worst at social mobility, according to a critical report published today. The elite institutions are marked down because of their low numbers of poor students, even though they give a bigger salary boost to such applicants. The government’s levelling-up plans will introduce new targets for universities, with the threat of cutting tuition fees for those that do not comply. They will be required to reduce dropout rates and get more graduates into highly paid, skilled jobs. They will also be expected to raise the academic achievements of poorer schoolchildren by offering lecturers and tutoring.', 'Pupils at outstanding schools are more stressed, sleep worse and feel more overworked compared to their peers at lower-rated institutions, a survey of 45,000 schoolchildren has found. The research, conducted by Edurio which carries out surveys for schools, found high rates of stress and anxiety among pupils and an increase in the number who felt lonely.', 'A trust running more than 20 private girls’ schools is facing the first strike by teachers in its 149-year history in a dispute over pensions. Members of the National Education Union (NEU) are voting on whether to begin strike action over the Girls’ Day School Trust’s plans to leave the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (TPS).', 'Odd-job workers will be sent out to people’s homes under plans for a “one-stop shop” model for social care to ease pressure on the NHS. Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said handymen and women could be dispatched by local councils as part of a team response so that ambulances were left free for more serious incidents. THIS is how we know that we live in him and he in us: he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. 1 John 4.13-14 (NIV)', 'A university drop-out who abandoned his medical studies to create a wearable armband that monitor patient’s health has sold the company for £300 million. Chris McCann launched Current Health in 2015 after coming up with the concept while doing rounds in hospital wards, having spent three years reading medicine at Dundee University.', 'A troubling pattern is emerging in how courts and clinicians decide when palliative care should be withdrawn from a patient — one that shows just how much control the state exercises over who lives and who dies. The issue has been highlighted by the plight of Alta Fixsler, a two-year-old girl who, having suffered a severe brain injury at birth, died in October after her family and I, their lawyer, could not convince the courts or the NHS to continue her care.', 'Patients facing long waits for treatment will be moved around the country to spare beds and follow-up appointments will be scrapped under NHS plans to deal with the post-pandemic backlog. Health chiefs have drawn up radical proposals to clear millions of people from waiting lists by freeing up doctors’ time and are set to present the blueprint to ministers within the next week.', 'Most people would like to think that on death their remains will be treated with dignity and respect. Which is why the recent case of a hospital electrician, David Fuller, who admitted to murdering two women and performing sexual acts on at least 100 female corpses — including those of children — in morgues, graphically highlights the issue of the safe keeping of bodies and human remains.', 'Eight years after AstraZeneca revealed plans for a global headquarters and research and development site in Cambridge, it finally opened the £1 billion site yesterday. The Discovery Centre in Cambridge — or Disc as it has been dubbed, because of its structure — features an “open, porous” collaborative design, including a college-style grass quad, and will host more than 2,200 research scientists.', 'The NHS has been accused of using racial profiling to target overseas patients in a charging system that is “unfit for purpose”. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank has found that the “increasingly stringent” system for charging in England has become a threat to public health. The rules “deter people from accessing healthcare, lead to delays in treatment, distract NHS professionals from care roles and apply large bills to patients with no prospect of paying them”, according to its report.', '“You don’t want to suffer any kind of stroke. But the one you really don’t want to have is the one caused by atrial fibrillation (AF),” says Dr Terry Quinn, a consultant stroke physician at the University of Glasgow, describing the devastating effect of strokes brought about by the heart condition. “With an AF stroke you are much more likely to die or be disabled, or to land in a care home or get dementia.” AF is behind one in five strokes. It is a common condition that affects about one in 50 adults and makes them five times more likely to have a stroke than if they didn’t have the condition. ', 'Being zipped inside a pair of Therabody RecoveryAir compression pants initially feels a bit like wearing jeans that are several sizes too small. Restrictive but bearable, provided you don’t attempt to bend, and best worn sitting or lying down. It is only when you flick the switch on a control box, connected by chunky wires, that you feel their full force as they hiss to inflate and then squeeze you like a tube of toothpaste with progressive, pulsating pressure from feet to calves, knees to hamstrings and quads. It is a mild discomfort apparently worth enduring, because this mangle effect is said to be the latest recovery aid for workout-weary leg muscles.', 'Kevin Spacey has been ordered to pay the production company behind House of Cards more than $30 million after an arbitrator ruled his sexual misconduct scandals amounted to a breach of contract. Spacey, 62, played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series but was fired amid a flurry of allegations that he had sexually assaulted young men, including on the show’s set. The actor was also an executive producer and was dismissed after production had begun on a sixth series.', 'A prominent Conservative donor helped a subsidiary company of his own firm to secure £50 million of PPE contracts, newly published documents show. Lord Chadlington, 79, has given nearly £100,000 to the Tory party over 20 years. The former PR executive helped David Cameron to get elected to the safe seat of Witney in 2001 and was president of the former prime minister’s local party association.', 'Drinking alcohol-free wine improves heart health as much as consuming modest amounts of normal wine, research suggests — indicating that the benefit comes from the grapes rather than the alcohol. The findings should help debunk the idea that a moderate amount of alcohol can help ward off heart problems, Dr Rudolph Schutte of Anglia Ruskin University said. ', 'A cancer treatment based on the technology behind Oxford University’s Covid-19 jab will be tested on humans for the first time after strong results in animal experiments. The “cancer vaccine” was able to shrink tumours in mice. It also improved their survival rates when it was coupled with another kind of therapy that is designed to turn a person’s immune system against their cancer.', 'It may not yet rival Simone Biles but engineers have created a robot that can take on an assault course with the deftness of an amateur gymnast. Atlas, a 1.5m (5ft), 89kg (14st) human-shaped robot designed by Boston Dynamics, is able to take on parkour, the sport of running atop and over obstacles.', 'A motorist who replaces their petrol or diesel car with a clean electric one may feel they have done their bit to help the planet. But what if it involves ripping up the flowers and shrubs in their front garden to accommodate a parking-space-cum-charging bay? Powering up overnight at home is both cheaper and more convenient than using commercial chargers and, as electric vehicle (EV) sales take off, the government is encouraging drivers to charge their cars at home, to accelerate the switch to zero-emission motoring.', 'Motorists face a winter of rising fuel prices, they were warned last night, after the cost of petrol hit a record high. Prices at the pumps rose to 142.94p for a litre of petrol, meaning that a typical family car costs about £15 more to fill up than a year ago.', 'The Lake District is a long way from my place and I’m going there to cheer on a friend who’s taking part in a fell race. It’s a test of his stamina and mine, or rather my electric car’s. It’s the long-range Ford Mustang Mach-E that can supposedly take you 379 miles before recharging, but I’m beset by the kind of mental gremlins that afflict runners. One hears wild tales of range overestimation and technical brick walls. I have to be back home in Cornwall the next day for business reasons. But it would allow me to answer the motoring question of the hour — can you replace your petrol car with an electric model if you drive long distances, for business or pleasure?', 'As business winds down at a delivery van depot in Bristol, vehicles head to cleaning bays and electric ones go to the recharging bay as the fleet parks up for the night. One van, though, is an oddity. Slightly futuristic in look, it picks its way round the depot, looking for all the world as if it is driven by a super-cautious operative.', 'For more than a century, vehicles have been powered by fossil fuels. Latest figures show that there are 32.7 million cars on UK roads, of which about 32.5 million are still propelled completely, or in part, by petrol or diesel. The future, however, will be electric. By the end of this decade, the UK will ban the sale of pure fossil fuel-powered cars and vans, followed five years later by hybrids which run using a combination of a combustion engine and battery.', 'Most people are happy enough to peruse a manufacturer’s brochure, choose a predetermined design, maybe embellish it with a favourite colour and hand over the funds. For others, however, only something unique will do: something like the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail. This car is not so much a flight of fancy as the result of an in-depth collaboration between craftsmen and client that has revived the art of coachbuilding. Although, under the hood, the four-seat, open-top grand tourer is fitted with a celebrated Rolls-Royce V12 engine, its hand-beaten aluminium bodywork and its fittings are unique, hence its price tag.', 'An estate agent has been awarded £185,000 after her boss refused to let her leave work early to collect her daughter from nursery. Alice Thompson told an employment tribunal that she wanted to work four days a week and to leave the office at 5pm, rather than an hour later as the agency normally required, because of her childcare arrangements. Her company director, Paul Sellar, rejected her request, claiming the business could not afford for her to work part-time.', 'A Michael Jackson impersonator has been suspended from a production of Jesus Christ Superstar after he was charged over his role in the January 6 riots at the US Capitol. James Beeks, 49, allegedly wore a “Bad” world tour jacket while joining a mob taking part in the insurrection, according to the Department of Justice.', 'I returned to the UK for the trial the day after Betty’s [Hands’ mother-in-law] death. Julia [his wife] had not had time to start grieving but wanted to be there for me. We spent that evening together, with our son joining us for dinner. Nothing seemed real. Those at Terra Firma, as well as the non-barristers in our team, tried to persuade our main barrister, the QC Lord Grabiner, not to put me on the stand that week. They wanted him to explain to the judge that I was in no state to be cross-examined.', 'The number of transgender prisoners in English and Welsh jails has risen by 20 per cent since 2019, Ministry of Justice figures show, with the vast majority identifying as women. They show the transgender prison population has increased from 163 in 2019 to 197 prisoners this year.', '', '', '', '', '', '']\n"
